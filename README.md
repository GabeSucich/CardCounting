# Card Counting Trainer

Blackjack is the only game in Vegas where the player can gain an edge over the house with statistical certainty. In order to
do this, players must master the art of counting cards -- keeping a tally of cards which have been dealt out of the deck in order to guage one's odds on each hand. This application provides a method for any blackjack player to become a proficient card counter. A clean front-end offers completely customizable practice games which develop players' abilities, and a SQL database stores stats so that users can track their progress over time.
